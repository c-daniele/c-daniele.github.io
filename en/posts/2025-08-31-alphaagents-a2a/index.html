Introduction The quantity of frameworks emerging for GenAI application development is incredible and, in my opinion, is becoming excessive. Every time a new framework appears, it seems to do more or less the same things as the previous one. Perhaps some have better modularization capabilities or more robust design against long-term obsolescence, but they all seem pretty much the same to me and, although I enjoy experimenting, the study of new miraculous and promising GenAI frameworks is becoming less and less appealing.\nJust to give you an idea, a few days ago, I came across AnyAgent: yet another framework that acts as a wrapper for other frameworks! Don’t get me wrong, the work that Mozilla’s AI team is doing is commendable and I also recommend reading their blog, which publishes very interesting articles, but this kind of Kafkaesque superstructure seems to introduce more problems than it solves because each stratification complicates software maintainability in the long run, not to mention all the issues with dependencies, compatibility, and updates.\nI also find it unnecessarily wasteful to specialize vertically in one framework or another, both for lock-in issues and to not lose that abstraction capability I need in designing an end-to-end solution.\nAnother area where almost all frameworks are showing their limitations is in multi-agent support. The very first GenAI development frameworks focused primarily on LLM wrapping, tracing, and chaining, while now most attention is directed toward agentic (I hate this word) capabilities, but in the vast majority of cases, the original framework design has remained the same.\nMost of these frameworks are still monolithic, making it difficult to realize a true multi-agent application without being constrained to the specific framework and underlying runtime.\nThis is where A2A (Agent-to-Agent) comes into play. The A2A protocol aims to enable smooth communication and collaboration between agents, regardless of the framework or runtime used, through standardized messaging formats and transport protocols. Rather than continuing to study or delve deeper into this or that framework, I decided to take the A2A protocol seriously and try to implement an end-to-end application solution compatible with this standard.\nThe first step was solving the discovery problem, and in my previous post I described how to build a simple Agent Registry that fits well with the A2A protocol.\nSubsequently, I wanted to dive into a concrete use case, so I looked for an interesting application to tackle with my new A2A-compliant Multi-Agent architecture. I then happened to come across the AlphaAgents paper, published a few days ago on arXiv by the BlackRock team.\nThe paper describes a multi-agent collaboration approach to support stock selection and financial analysis starting from a set of securities. I thought it was a perfect use case and jumped right in!\nUnfortunately, the BlackRock team did not release the source code, so I had to implement the entire AlphaAgent solution by myself, using the paper as a high-level specification. I still had to make some assumptions and trade-offs; for example, the information extraction and synthesis tools for the fundamental analysis agent do not actually use RAG, but rather very basic keyword or prefix lookup techniques based on the data returned by Yahoo Finance. As a result, the implementation is not 100% compliant with what is described in the paper, but it can serve as a valid starting point.\nIn any case, my focus was more on the architecture than on the reliability of the individual agents’ responses. I also aimed for an agnostic approach regarding the underlying GenAI framework, where the orchestrator agent can search for and select specialized agents at runtime, thus completely ignoring the underlying details in terms of models, languages, and libraries.\nIn the following chapters, I’ll briefly recap what AlphaAgents is and how it works in theory, then describe the architecture of my A2A-compliant implementation and some technical details, and finally show what happens during each step of a concrete execution.\nI’ll add a disclaimer that’s probably obvious but mandatory: the system output is intended purely as a demonstration of the multi-agent solution and should not be considered in any way as input for any type of financial decision. I also point out that, although I’ve performed some spot checks for consistency on the calculated KPIs and found results more or less in line with expectations, no thorough or rigorous validation of the results was performed. Therefore, I cannot rule out the possibility of systematic errors or responses influenced by LLM hallucinations.\n2. Brief Introduction to AlphaAgents The AlphaAgents paper introduces an innovative approach to the stock selection problem through a multi-agent system based on Large Language Models (LLMs).\n2.1 The Problem and Solution Traditional portfolio analysis requires considerable human effort to process enormous amounts of heterogeneous data: SEC documents (10-K, 10-Q), earnings call transcripts, target prices, financial ratios, market news, and sector research. This process also presents significant challenges in terms of scalability and objectivity. One of the risks cited multiple times in the paper is that of leaning toward sub-optimal allocations due to subjective factors such as risk aversion or excessive confidence in one’s intuitions.\nAlphaAgents address these problems through a multi-agent framework that incorporates some adversarial reasoning techniques and divides financial analysis into distinct specialization areas, each managed by a dedicated agent.\n2.2 The Three Agents Fundamental Agent: Handles traditional fundamental analysis, examining financial statements, cash flows, and financial performance in depth through analysis of SEC documents and financial reports.\nSentiment Agent: Analyzes market sentiment through processing financial news, analyst rating changes, and corporate disclosures to assess potential impact on stock prices.\nValuation Agent: Focuses on technical and quantitative analysis, processing historical price and volume data to calculate volatility metrics, risk-adjusted returns, and valuation indicators.\n2.3 Collaboration and Debate Mechanism The framework implements a centralized coordination mechanism through a Group Chat Agent that manages interaction between specialized agents. This coordinator agent:\nRoutes requests to the most appropriate agents based on the type of analysis required using an LLM-based approach Manages the structured debate process implementing a round-robin approach Ensures fair participation by ensuring each agent speaks at least twice during the debate Facilitates convergence through a consensus building system that involves sharing intermediate results with all agents Synthesizes multiple analyses into a coherent report highlighting the debate process Mitigates hallucinations through cross-agent comparison and collaborative validation In summary: agents engage in sequential turns until consensus is reached, eliminating the risk that some agents dominate the discussion.\ngraph TD A[User Request] --\u003e B[Group Chat Agent] B --\u003e C{LLM-based Debate Detection} C --\u003e|Investment Decision| D[Structured Debate Mode] C --\u003e|Factual Query| E[Simple Coordination] D --\u003e F[Round 1: Initial Positions] F --\u003e G[Agent 1 Turn] G --\u003e H[Agent 2 Turn] H --\u003e I[Agent 3 Turn] I --\u003e J[Round 2: Debate \u0026 Counter-arguments] J --\u003e K[Agent 1 Response] K --\u003e L[Agent 2 Response] L --\u003e M[Agent 3 Response] M --\u003e N{Consensus Check} N --\u003e|No Consensus| O[Additional RoundsMax 5 rounds] O --\u003e J N --\u003e|Consensus| P[Participation CheckMin 2 turns each] P --\u003e|Insufficient| Q[Extra Turns] Q --\u003e P P --\u003e|Sufficient| R[Debate Consolidation] E --\u003e S[Concurrent Agent Calls] S --\u003e T[Simple Consolidation] R --\u003e U[Final Report with Debate Metadata] T --\u003e V[Final Report - Standard] style B fill:#e1f5fe style D fill:#fff3e0 style N fill:#ffecb3 style R fill:#e8f5e8 style C fill:#f3e5f5 2.4 Intelligent Risk Tolerance Management One innovative aspect of the framework is the incorporation of risk tolerance profiles indicated by the user. The paper doesn’t specify precisely how the BlackRock team implemented the introduction of these profiles, but I hypothesize they used prompting mechanisms to automatically infer the risk level from the user query. Starting from this query analysis, a precise indication of the desired risk profile is then extrapolated, which is then used in all interactions with the agents.\nThis simple expedient therefore allows adding a level of personalization to the recommendations provided by the agents.\n2.4.1 Risk Profile Classification Risk-averse: Conservative investors who prioritize capital preservation, stable returns, dividend-paying stocks, low volatility, safety-first approach Risk-neutral: Balanced investors seeking moderate growth with reasonable risk, diversified portfolios, standard market exposure Risk-seeking: Aggressive investors pursuing high returns, accepting high volatility, growth stocks, speculative investments 2.4.2 Automatic Classification Examples 🟢 Risk-Averse (Conservative): \"I'm looking for safe and stable investments for my retirement\" \"I'm looking for safe stocks with regular dividends\" \"I want to preserve my capital without risks\" 🟡 Risk-Neutral (Balanced): \"Should I invest in Tesla? I want a balanced analysis\" \"Should I invest in Apple stock?\" \"Microsoft stock analysis for my portfolio\" 🔴 Risk-Seeking (Aggressive): \"I want high-growth stocks even if volatile\" \"I want maximum returns, I can handle high risk\" \"I'm looking for high-potential investments\" 2.4.3 Integration in the Debate Process The inferred risk profile is automatically:\nPassed to all specialized agents via metadata in the JSON-RPC message Maintained throughout the debate for recommendation consistency Logged for decision process transparency Used to personalize the analyses of each specialist agent 2.5 Advantages of Multi-Agent Approach with Structured Debate The system offers several benefits compared to traditional analysis:\nBias mitigation: Each agent operates independently, reducing the impact of human cognitive biases Fair participation: The turn-taking mechanism allows all agents to contribute fairly Collaborative validation: Individual positions are challenged and refined through direct confrontation Guided convergence: The consensus building system leads to more robust and thoughtful decisions Automatic personalization: Risk tolerance inferred automatically for tailored analyses Multilingual adaptation: Native system for users of any language without configuration Scalability: Ability to process much larger volumes of information Specialization: Each agent can develop deep expertise in its domain Flexibility: The framework can be extended with additional agents (e.g., Technical Analysis Agent, Macro Economist Agent) 3. Starting Point To implement the code, I made extensive use of Claude Code, but I dedicated a significant amount of time to defining the detailed technical specifications compared to what I had in mind after reading the paper (e.g., class structure, tool management, etc.), as well as testing and modifying or revising some classes and methods.\nAssuming that each agent could be implemented independently, I based myself for simplicity on the following ecosystem:\nRuntime: Python3.12 Package manager: uv GenAI Framework: Langchain Agents (but it could be replaced with another framework like Autogen, CrewAI, Smolagents, etc) Serving Layer: FastAPI Communication protocol: JSON-RPC Testing: simple relaunchable python scripts Architecture based on Agent Registry, with dynamic discovery of Agent Card for each agent LLM: for simplicity I used GPT-4o, without worrying too much about model choice In the following chapters, I illustrate in detail the architecture and implementation. Obviously, one of the preparatory steps was also to equip each agent with an endpoint to expose the Agent Card according to the usual “.well-known/agent-card” path and register the agents within the Agent Registry (Figure 1)\nFigure 1 - Adding the Valuation Agent 4. High-Level Design The architecture is quite simple: it consists of:\n1 Agent Registry that manages agent registration and discovery (this is the module I discussed in my previous article) 3 specialized agents, each running on a specific host and port (in my case, localhost and ports 3001-3003) 1 orchestration agent, which receives user inputs, calls other agents, and produces the final response. 4.1 Overall Logical Architecture I launched all agents locally and configured the Agent Cards accordingly, but obviously the system is designed to also support distributed deployments.\n%%{init: {\"themeVariables\": { \"fontSize\": \"16px\", \"nodeSpacing\": 50, \"rankSpacing\": 70 }}}%% graph TD %% Client Layer subgraph \"Client Layer\" CLI[CLI Client] WEB[Web Interface] API[API Client] end %% A2A Protocol Layer subgraph \"A2A Protocol Layer\" JSONRPC[JSON-RPC Transport] A2AMSG[A2A Message Format] end %% Agent Registry subgraph \"Agent Registry\" REG[Agent Registry Service] REGDB[(Agent Cards DB)] end %% Orchestration Layer subgraph \"Orchestration Layer\" GCA[Group Chat Agent] ROUTER[Intelligent Routing] CONSOLIDATOR[Response Consolidator] end %% Specialized Agents subgraph \"Specialized Agents\" FA[Fundamental Agent:3002] SA[Sentiment Agent:3003] VA[Valuation Agent:3001] end %% External Data Sources subgraph \"External Data Sources\" YF[Yahoo Finance API] SEC[SEC EDGAR API] NEWS[\"Financial News APIs\"] end %% AI/LLM Layer subgraph \"AI/LLM Layer\" GPT[OpenAI GPT-4o] VADER[VADER Sentiment] TEXTBLOB[TextBlob Analysis] end %% Connessioni principali CLI --\u003e JSONRPC WEB --\u003e JSONRPC API --\u003e JSONRPC JSONRPC --\u003e A2AMSG A2AMSG --\u003e GCA GCA --\u003e REG REG --\u003e REGDB GCA --\u003e ROUTER ROUTER --\u003e FA ROUTER --\u003e SA ROUTER --\u003e VA FA --\u003e CONSOLIDATOR SA --\u003e CONSOLIDATOR VA --\u003e CONSOLIDATOR CONSOLIDATOR 4.2 Registration Process In my case, I manually performed registration on the agent registry (Figure 1), however the process could easily be automated. Essentially, each Agent that wants to be published within the organization could autonomously register on the Agent Registry.\nWhether in the case of manual or automatic registration, the Group Chat Agent can then query the Agent Registry and discover the specialized agents needed to respond to a user request and decide how to orchestrate communication between them.\nsequenceDiagram participant GCA as Group Chat Agent participant REG as Agent Registry participant FA as Fundamental Agent participant SA as Sentiment Agent participant VA as Valuation Agent Note over FA,VA: Agent Startup \u0026 Registration FA-\u003e\u003eREG: POST /agents/register{agent_card, endpoints} REG--\u003e\u003eFA: 200 OK {agent_id} SA-\u003e\u003eREG: POST /agents/register{agent_card, endpoints} REG--\u003e\u003eSA: 200 OK {agent_id} VA-\u003e\u003eREG: POST /agents/register{agent_card, endpoints} REG--\u003e\u003eVA: 200 OK {agent_id} Note over GCA,REG: Agent Discovery GCA-\u003e\u003eREG: GET /agents/search?skills=fundamental,sentiment,valuation REG--\u003e\u003eGCA: 200 OK {agents[]} Note over GCA,VA: Health Check \u0026 Validation GCA-\u003e\u003eFA: GET /health FA--\u003e\u003eGCA: 200 OK {status: healthy} GCA-\u003e\u003eSA: GET /health SA--\u003e\u003eGCA: 200 OK {status: healthy} GCA-\u003e\u003eVA: GET /health VA--\u003e\u003eGCA: 200 OK {status: healthy} 4.3 Agent Card Each agent exposes its capabilities through an Agent Card compliant with the A2A schema. For example, here is the Agent Card for the Fundamental Agent:\n{ \"name\": \"Fundamental Analysis Agent\", \"description\": \"Specialized agent for fundamental equity analysis.

Implementation The AlphaAgents implementation was created with a focus on modularity, testability, and A2A protocol compliance. Each agent is an independent application with its own dependencies and can be deployed separately.\nImplementation Note: As mentioned in the introduction, the implementation differs from the original paper in some technical aspects. In particular:\nThe Sentiment Agent uses VADER and TextBlob libraries which should represent a simple but effective solution since presumably news will be exclusively in English and won’t require deep contextual understanding. In the future, more sophisticated sentiment analysis models based on LLM or specific models like FinBERT could be integrated. The Fundamental Agent employs keyword matching on Yahoo Finance data instead of true RAG techniques with vector databases In general, I focused on architecture rather than specific performance of individual agents All code is available on GitHub.\n5.1 Technology Stack and Dependencies The project uses Python 3.12 as runtime with uv as package manager for rapid dependency management.

Its main responsibilities include:\nIntelligent debate detection: Uses LLM to determine if the query requires structured debate Automatic risk tolerance inference: Analyzes user message to identify risk profile Multilingual routing: Identifies necessary agents regardless of query language Debate orchestration: Manages fair participation through a round-robin turn system Consensus monitoring: Verifies agreement and terminates debate when appropriate Metadata enhancement: Automatically enriches metadata with risk_tolerance for all agents 5.3.1 Risk Tolerance Inference The system uses an LLM-based classifier that analyzes the user’s message to infer the risk profile. The classification guidelines include:\nExplicit risk preferences: Terms like “conservative,” “aggressive,” “high growth,” “safe,” “stable” Investment timeframe: Mentions of “retirement,” “long term,” “quick gains” Vocabulary analysis: Linguistic choices and tone (cautious vs confident vs speculative) Asset types mentioned: Bonds/dividends = averse, growth stock = seeking Multilingual support: Works in any language by analyzing intent and risk signals As I anticipated earlier, I have no idea how the BlackRock researchers identified the risk profile. However, it’s easy to imagine they did something similar.\n5.3.2 Code Excerpt Below is an excerpt from the A2AGroupChatAgent class illustrating some of the main methods:\nclass A2AGroupChatAgent: def __init__(self, openai_api_key: str, registry_url: str, model_name: str = \"gpt-4o\"): self.llm = ChatOpenAI( model=model_name, openai_api_key=openai_api_key, temperature=0.1 # Low temperature for financial analysis ) self.registry_service = AgentRegistryService(registry_url) self._agent_urls = {} def _requires_debate_analysis(self, user_message: str) -\u003e bool: \"\"\"Uses LLM to intelligently determine if structured debate is needed.\"\"\" system_prompt = \"\"\"You are a debate necessity classifier for a multi-agent financial analysis system.

Keyword-Based Implementation The fundamental analysis does not use RAG techniques, but employs a very elementary approach based on keyword matching starting from the metadata returned by Yahoo Finance:\nclass RAGAnalysisTool(BaseTool): # Name kept for compatibility and future evolution, but NOT true RAG name: str = \"rag_fundamental_analysis\" description: str = \"Performs fundamental analysis using keyword-based data extraction\" def _find_cash_flow_key(self, data: Dict[str, Any], possible_keys: List[str]) -\u003e Optional[str]: \"\"\"Find correct key for cash flow data using pattern matching.\"\"\" for item_name, _ in data.items(): for key in possible_keys: if key.lower() in item_name.lower(): return item_name return None def _analyze_cash_flow(self, financial_context: Dict[str, Any], guidance: Dict[str, Any]): \"\"\"Analyze cash flow with keyword search, not RAG.\"\"\" quarterly_data = financial_context.get(\"cash_flow\", {}).get(\"quarterly\", {}).get(\"data\", {}) if quarterly_data: # Search for \"Operating Cash Flow\" using keyword matching operating_cf_key = self._find_cash_flow_key( quarterly_data, [\"Operating Cash Flow\", \"Total Cash From Operating Activities\"] ) if operating_cf_key: # Extract values using found pattern cf_values = [] for period, values in quarterly_data.items(): if operating_cf_key in values and values[operating_cf_key] is not None: cf_values.append(values[operating_cf_key]) 5.5.4 Valuation Agent Tools The Valuation Agent implements specialized financial calculations using pandas and numpy:\nclass VolatilityCalculationTool(BaseTool): name: str = \"calculate_volatility_metrics\" description: str = \"Calculates comprehensive volatility and risk metrics\" def _run(self, symbol: str, risk_free_rate: float = 0.05) -\u003e Dict[str, Any]: \"\"\"Calculate volatility and risk metrics synchronously.\"\"\" try: # First fetch the data stock_tool = StockDataTool() stock_data = stock_tool._run(symbol) if not stock_data[\"success\"]: return stock_data # Convert to pandas DataFrame for calculations price_data = stock_data[\"price_data\"] df = pd.DataFrame({ 'Date': pd.to_datetime(price_data[\"dates\"]), 'Close': price_data[\"close\"], 'Volume': price_data[\"volume\"] }) df.set_index('Date', inplace=True) # Calculate daily returns df['Daily_Return'] = df['Close'].pct_change() df = df.dropna() if len(df) \u003c 2: return { \"success\": False, \"error\": \"Insufficient data for calculations\", \"symbol\": symbol } # Basic metrics daily_returns = df['Daily_Return'] # Daily metrics mean_daily_return = daily_returns.mean() daily_volatility = daily_returns.std() # Calculate cumulative return for proper annualized return start_price = df['Close'].iloc[0] end_price = df['Close'].iloc[-1] cumulative_return = (end_price / start_price) -

Before launching the entire stack, I used these endpoints for registration within the Agent Registry:\n@app.get(\"/.well-known/agent-card\") async def get_agent_card(): return { \"name\": \"Valuation Analysis Agent\", \"description\": \"Specialized agent for stock valuation and technical analysis\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"protocolVersion\": \"0.3.0\", \"url\": \"http://0.0.0.0:3001/\", \"preferredTransport\": \"JSONRPC\", \"skills\": [ { \"id\": \"technical_valuation_analysis\", \"name\": \"Technical Valuation Analysis\", \"description\": \"Comprehensive technical analysis using historical data\", \"tags\": [\"technical-analysis\", \"volatility-analysis\", \"valuation-metrics\"] } ] } 5.7 Consolidation Pattern with LLM The consolidation of specialist analyses uses a meta-prompt pattern to synthesize different perspectives.\ndef _consolidate_analyses(self, agent_responses: List[Dict], user_message: str) -\u003e str: system_prompt = \"\"\"You are a financial analysis consolidator.

X-Ray Scan of a User Request To understand well how the AlphaAgents system works, let’s see it in action! I performed an end-to-end test using a significant user query that requires the involvement of all three specialized agents.\nUser query: “I’m undecided whether to invest in Tesla or Palantir.

My investment horizon is 5-7 years and I want maximum returns, I can handle high risk AGENT ANALYSES: **VALUATION AGENT:** [Complete analysis with quantitative metrics...] **SENTIMENT AGENT:** [Sentiment analysis with news distribution...] **FUNDAMENTAL AGENT:** [Fundamental analysis with score...] \"\"\" 6.7.2 Final Report The system generates a complete final report that integrates all specialist analyses. Here is the report in its entirety:\n📊 ALPHAAGENTS INVESTMENT ANALYSIS REPORT\nThe analysis of whether to invest in Tesla (TSLA) or Palantir (PLTR) over a 5-7 year horizon, with a focus on maximizing returns and a willingness to manage high risk, was conducted through a structured multi-agent debate process. This comprehensive approach involved valuation, sentiment, and fundamental analyses, ensuring a well-rounded perspective.\n🎯 CONSENSUS AND KEY FINDINGS:\n1. Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR)\nValuation: Palantir has demonstrated an extraordinary annualized return of 423.86% with a high Sharpe ratio of 5.77, indicating exceptional risk-adjusted returns. The volatility is high, but the risk-reward profile is favorable. Sentiment: The sentiment analysis shows a strong positive outlook, with 83% of articles reflecting positive sentiment. This aligns with the valuation analysis, reinforcing Palantir’s growth potential. Fundamentals: Palantir’s strong growth metrics and operational efficiency support the positive sentiment and valuation findings. Recommendation: STRONG BUY. Palantir is recommended for risk-seeking investors due to its exceptional growth potential and positive sentiment, making it an attractive option for maximizing returns.\n2. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA):\nValuation: Tesla has a strong annualized return of 59.42% with high volatility. The Sharpe ratio of 0.76 suggests moderate risk-adjusted returns. The potential for significant returns exists, but with substantial risk. Sentiment: The sentiment analysis is neutral with a slight negative tilt, reflecting concerns about automotive sector challenges and regulatory issues with Tesla’s Full Self-Driving technology. Fundamentals: Operational challenges and strategic uncertainties contribute to a more cautious outlook. Recommendation: HOLD. While Tesla has potential upside, the current sentiment and operational challenges suggest a more cautious approach. Investors should wait for more positive sentiment or strategic clarity before increasing exposure.\n🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nBased on the collective reasoning from the multi-agent debate, Palantir (PLTR) is the preferred choice for a risk-seeking investor aiming for maximum returns over a 5-7 year horizon. Its strong positive sentiment, exceptional risk-adjusted returns, and growth potential make it a compelling investment.\nTesla (TSLA), while still a strong contender, is recommended as a hold due to its current neutral sentiment and operational challenges. Investors should monitor Tesla for strategic developments that could enhance its investment appeal.\nThis analysis benefits from the collaborative insights of multiple expert perspectives, providing increased confidence in the recommendations provided.\n6.7.3 Debate Process Metadata The final report also includes some metadata about the process followed, which can be used for explainability analysis:\n{ \"debate_metadata\": { \"total_rounds\": 2, \"agents_participated\": [\"valuation\", \"sentiment\", \"fundamental\"], \"consensus_achieved\": true, \"consensus_percentage\": 100, \"risk_tolerance_inferred\": \"seeking\", \"debate_duration\": \"3m 32s\", \"llm_calls\": { \"risk_inference\": 1, \"agent_routing\": 1, \"debate_detection\": 1, \"consolidation\": 1 } } } 6.8 Performance and Execution Times An important aspect to document is the time needed to complete the entire analysis process. Based on the timestamps recorded during execution, here is the detailed temporal breakdown:\n6.8.1 Overall Duration Total execution time: 3 minutes and 32 seconds (from 19:09:40 to 19:13:12)\n6.8.2 Temporal Breakdown by Phases Phase Duration Start Timestamp End Timestamp Description Initial Setup ~41s 19:06:50 19:07:31 Launch of all agents, Agent Registry, Healthcheck and basic verifications Query Processing ~1s 19:09:40 19:09:41 User query reception and parsing Risk Tolerance Inference \u003c1s 19:09:40 19:09:40 LLM analysis to infer risk profile Agent Discovery \u003c1s 19:09:40 19:09:40 Endpoint retrieval from Agent Registry Agent Routing ~1s 19:09:41 19:09:41 LLM decision on agents to involve Debate Detection \u003c1s 19:09:41 19:09:41 LLM decision for structured debate Round 1 Analysis ~91s 19:09:41 19:11:12 Sequential initial analyses of 3 agents Round 2 Debate ~120s 19:11:12 19:13:12 Second round and final consolidation 6.8.3 Analysis of Most Expensive Components The most time-intensive phases are:\nRound 1 Analysis (91 seconds):\nValuation Agent: ~30s for Yahoo Finance data retrieval + volatility calculations Sentiment Agent: ~30s for news collection from multiple sources + VADER/TextBlob analysis Fundamental Agent: ~31s for financial data processing + keyword matching Round 2 Debate (120 seconds):\nStructured debate: ~60s for second round of cross-agent analysis LLM Consolidation: ~60s for final synthesis and report generation 6.8.4 Bottlenecks and Possible Optimizations Identified bottlenecks:\nAPI Latency: Calls to Yahoo Finance (~2-3s per request) LLM Processing: Complex analyses require 10-15s per agent Sequential Execution: Sequential turns not parallelizable by design Future optimizations:\nRound 1 Parallelization: Potential reduction from 91s to ~35-40s Financial data caching: Avoid multiple retrievals of same tickers Model optimization: More efficient prompts or faster models 6.8.5 Performance Considerations The time of 3:32 minutes represents an optimal compromise for the financial use case:\n✅ Acceptable for:\nFinancial analyses where accuracy \u003e speed Investors requiring multi-perspective validation Medium to long-term investment decisions ⚠️ To improve for:\nHigh-frequency trading Real-time market analysis Scenarios with high volume of simultaneous requests 6.9 End-to-End Process Conclusions This complete trace demonstrates how the AlphaAgents system automatically orchestrates a sophisticated analysis process in 3:32 minutes, including:\nIntelligent discovery of agents via Agent Registry Automatic inference of risk tolerance via LLM semantic analysis Multilingual routing to identify relevant agents Structured debate with strict turn-taking and consensus building Sequential specialist analyses with advanced tool calling Multi-perspective consolidation via LLM meta-prompt Final report with complete process metadata Final result: Strong recommendation for Palantir Technologies based on unanimous agent consensus, supported by:\nSuperior return metrics (423% vs 59%) Positive sentiment vs neutral for Tesla Solid fundamentals (80% margins vs 17% for Tesla) Alignment with risk-seeking profile and 5-7 year horizon This multi-agent approach with structured debate allowed for clearly identifying the optimal investment through collaborative validation and individual bias mitigation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the A2A-compliant framework in real financial analysis scenarios with reasonable performance for the application domain.\n7. Conclusions 7.1 Project Motivations and Objectives This project was born from the need to concretely test the A2A protocol and Agent Registry in a real application scenario, to experiment with a distributed multi-agent application.\nAs I highlighted in the introduction, the proliferation of monolithic GenAI frameworks and their limitations in multi-agent support pushed me to invest some time to raise the level of abstraction and try to design an A2A-based agent architecture, in order to guarantee:\nCommunication standardization between heterogeneous agents Elimination of lock-in to specific frameworks Horizontal scalability through distributed deployments Interoperability between agents implemented with different technology stacks This small project kept me up a few nights but gave me the chance to get hands-on with a REAL multi-agent system different from the monolithic case study that is often presented in the “Getting Started” section of this or that GenAI framework.\nI’m increasingly convinced that for Enterprise solutions, it’s worth starting to think seriously about agent architecture and collaboration protocols rather than the specific technology stack for implementing this or that Use Case.\n7.2 The Choice of AlphaAgents The selection of the BlackRock AlphaAgents paper as a use case proved particularly successful because, despite not overly high complexity, it allowed me to create an end-to-end solution with tangible and measurable results.\nCompared to the original paper, I had to accept some compromises to simplify implementation, but this did not compromise achieving my objective.\n7.3 Future Developments The end-to-end test confirmed the validity of the approach and also provided me with some insights for future improvements.\n7.4.1 Technical Improvements Performance Optimization:\nRound 1 Parallelization: Potential reduction from 91s to ~35s Data caching: Avoid multiple retrievals of same tickers LLM optimization: Prompt engineering to reduce latency Agent reliability:\nSentiment Agent: FinBERT integration for more accurate analysis Fundamental Agent: True RAG implementation with vector embeddings Risk Assessment: More sophisticated models for portfolio risk management Registry improvements:\nAgent versioning and compatibility management Load balancing for agents with multiple instances Health monitoring and automatic failover 7.4.2 Functional Expansions New Specialized Agents:\nTechnical Analysis Agent: Pattern recognition, support/resistance Macro Economic Agent: Macroeconomic and sectoral analysis ESG Agent: Environmental, Social, Governance scoring Options Agent: Derivatives analysis and hedging strategies Accurate results verification:\nDouble check of metrics calculated by Valuation Agent on large data samples Cross-validation with other valuation models 7.5 Considerations on Financial Results 7.5.1 Limitations and Risks Technical Limitations:\nLimited data: Much of the analysis is based on Yahoo Finance data, not professional sources Lack of backtesting: As I emphasized multiple times, I performed no systematic validation on historical data Restricted scope: The analysis sample on which I did end-to-end tests is limited to few stocks and few types of user requests Risks:\nLLM hallucinations: Possible erroneous or contradictory analyses Data quality: Input data accuracy not guaranteed Model bias: Bias in language models used Market conditions: Doesn’t consider current macroeconomic conditions 7.5.2 ⚠️ Important Disclaimer Also in light of the limitations indicated above, all results, recommendations and analyses presented in this article are exclusively for exemplification purposes to illustrate the multi-agent system operation.\nThe results reported here and the software released on GitHub must NOT be used in any way as:\nBasis for real investment decisions Financial advice or trading recommendations Input for portfolio

class=post-content><h1 id=1-introduction>1. Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-introduction>#</a></h1><p>The quantity of frameworks emerging for GenAI application development is incredible and, in my opinion, is becoming excessive.
Every time a new framework appears, it seems to do more or less the same things as the previous one. Perhaps some have better modularization capabilities or more robust design against long-term obsolescence, but they all seem pretty much the same to me and, although I enjoy experimenting, the study of new miraculous and promising GenAI frameworks is becoming less and less appealing.</p><p>Just to give you an idea, a few days ago, I came across <a href=https://mozilla-ai.github.io/any-agent/>AnyAgent</a>: yet another framework that acts as a wrapper for other frameworks!</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the work that Mozilla&rsquo;s AI team is doing is commendable and I also recommend reading their <a href=https://blog.mozilla.ai/>blog</a>, which publishes very interesting articles, but this kind of <em>Kafkaesque</em> superstructure seems to introduce more problems than it solves because each stratification complicates software maintainability in the long run, not to mention all the issues with dependencies, compatibility, and updates.</p><p>I also find it unnecessarily wasteful to specialize vertically in one framework or another, both for lock-in issues and to not lose that abstraction capability I need in designing an end-to-end solution.</p><p>Another area where almost all frameworks are showing their limitations is in <strong>multi-agent support</strong>.
The very first GenAI development frameworks focused primarily on LLM wrapping, tracing, and chaining, while now most attention is directed toward <em>agentic</em> (I hate this word) capabilities, but in the vast majority of cases, the original framework design has remained the same.</p><p>Most of these frameworks are still <strong>monolithic</strong>, making it <strong>difficult to realize a true multi-agent application</strong> without being constrained to the specific framework and underlying runtime.</p><p>This is where A2A (Agent-to-Agent) comes into play. The A2A protocol aims to enable smooth communication and collaboration between agents, regardless of the framework or runtime used, through standardized messaging formats and transport protocols.
Rather than continuing to study or delve deeper into this or that framework, I decided to <strong>take the A2A protocol seriously</strong> and try to implement an end-to-end application solution compatible with this standard.</p><p>The first step was solving the discovery problem, and in <a href=https://c-daniele.github.io/en/posts/2025-08-15-agent-reg-for-a2a/>my previous post</a> I described how to build a simple Agent Registry that fits well with the A2A protocol.</p><p>Subsequently, I wanted to dive into a concrete use case, so I looked for an interesting application to tackle with my new A2A-compliant Multi-Agent architecture.
I then happened to come across the <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11152v1>AlphaAgents</a> paper, published a few days ago on arXiv by the BlackRock team.</p><p>The paper describes a multi-agent collaboration approach to <strong>support stock selection and financial analysis starting from a set of securities</strong>. I thought it was a perfect use case and jumped right in!</p><p>Unfortunately, the BlackRock team did not release the source code, so I had to implement the entire AlphaAgent solution <a href=https://github.com/c-daniele/alpha-agents-a2a>by myself</a>, using the paper as a high-level specification. I still had to make some assumptions and trade-offs; for example, the information extraction and synthesis tools for the fundamental analysis agent do not actually use RAG, but rather very basic keyword or prefix lookup techniques based on the data returned by Yahoo Finance. As a result, the implementation is not 100% compliant with what is described in the paper, but it can serve as a valid starting point.</p><p>In any case, my focus was more on the architecture than on the reliability of the individual agents&rsquo; responses. I also aimed for an agnostic approach regarding the underlying GenAI framework, where the orchestrator agent can <strong>search for and select specialized agents at runtime</strong>, thus completely ignoring the underlying details in terms of models, languages, and libraries.</p><p>In the following chapters, I’ll briefly recap what AlphaAgents is and how it works in theory, then describe the architecture of my A2A-compliant implementation and some technical details, and finally show what happens during each step of a concrete execution.</p><p>I’ll add a disclaimer that’s probably obvious but mandatory: the system output is intended purely as a demonstration of the multi-agent solution and <strong>should not be considered in any way as input for any type of financial decision</strong>. I also point out that, although I&rsquo;ve performed some spot checks for consistency on the calculated KPIs and found results more or less in line with expectations, <strong>no thorough or rigorous validation</strong> of the results was performed. Therefore, I cannot rule out the possibility of systematic errors or responses influenced by LLM hallucinations.</p><h1 id=2-brief-introduction-to-alphaagents>2. Brief Introduction to AlphaAgents<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-brief-introduction-to-alphaagents>#</a></h1><p>The <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11152v1>AlphaAgents</a> paper introduces an innovative approach to the stock selection problem through a multi-agent system based on Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><h2 id=21-the-problem-and-solution>2.1 The Problem and Solution<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#21-the-problem-and-solution>#</a></h2><p>Traditional portfolio analysis requires considerable human effort to process enormous amounts of heterogeneous data: SEC documents (10-K, 10-Q), earnings call transcripts, target prices, financial ratios, market news, and sector research. This process also presents significant challenges in terms of scalability and objectivity. One of the risks cited multiple times in the paper is that of leaning toward sub-optimal allocations due to <strong>subjective factors such as risk aversion</strong> or excessive confidence in one&rsquo;s intuitions.</p><p>AlphaAgents address these problems through a multi-agent framework that <strong>incorporates some adversarial reasoning techniques</strong> and divides financial analysis into distinct specialization areas, each managed by a dedicated agent.</p><h2 id=22-the-three-agents>2.2 The Three Agents<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#22-the-three-agents>#</a></h2><p><strong>Fundamental Agent</strong>: Handles traditional fundamental analysis, examining financial statements, cash flows, and financial performance in depth through analysis of SEC documents and financial reports.</p><p><strong>Sentiment Agent</strong>: Analyzes market sentiment through processing financial news, analyst rating changes, and corporate disclosures to assess potential impact on stock prices.</p><p><strong>Valuation Agent</strong>: Focuses on technical and quantitative analysis, processing historical price and volume data to calculate volatility metrics, risk-adjusted returns, and valuation indicators.</p><h2 id=23-collaboration-and-debate-mechanism>2.3 Collaboration and Debate Mechanism<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#23-collaboration-and-debate-mechanism>#</a></h2><p>The framework implements a centralized coordination mechanism through a <strong>Group Chat Agent</strong> that manages interaction between specialized agents. This coordinator agent:</p><ol><li><strong>Routes requests</strong> to the most appropriate agents based on the type of analysis required using an LLM-based approach</li><li><strong>Manages the structured debate process</strong> implementing a round-robin approach</li><li><strong>Ensures fair participation</strong> by ensuring each agent speaks at least twice during the debate</li><li><strong>Facilitates convergence</strong> through a consensus building system that involves sharing intermediate results with all agents</li><li><strong>Synthesizes multiple analyses</strong> into a coherent report highlighting the debate process</li><li><strong>Mitigates hallucinations</strong> through cross-agent comparison and collaborative validation</li></ol><p>In summary: agents engage in sequential turns until consensus is reached, eliminating the risk that some agents dominate the discussion.</p><div class=mermaid>graph TD

The paper doesn&rsquo;t specify precisely how the BlackRock team implemented the introduction of these profiles, but I hypothesize they used prompting mechanisms to <strong>automatically infer</strong> the risk level from the user query.
Starting from this query analysis, a precise indication of the desired risk profile is then extrapolated, which is then used in all interactions with the agents.</p><p>This simple expedient therefore allows adding a level of personalization to the recommendations provided by the agents.</p><h3 id=241-risk-profile-classification>2.4.1 Risk Profile Classification<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#241-risk-profile-classification>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Risk-averse</strong>: Conservative investors who prioritize capital preservation, stable returns, dividend-paying stocks, low volatility, safety-first approach</li><li><strong>Risk-neutral</strong>: Balanced investors seeking moderate growth with reasonable risk, diversified portfolios, standard market exposure</li><li><strong>Risk-seeking</strong>: Aggressive investors pursuing high returns, accepting high volatility, growth stocks, speculative investments</li></ul><h3 id=242-automatic-classification-examples>2.4.2 Automatic Classification Examples<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#242-automatic-classification-examples>#</a></h3><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-plaintext data-lang=plaintext><span class=line><span class=cl>🟢 Risk-Averse (Conservative):

Obviously, one of the preparatory steps was also to equip each agent with an endpoint to expose the Agent Card according to the usual &ldquo;<em>.well-known/agent-card</em>&rdquo; path and register the agents within the Agent Registry (Figure 1)</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><a href=/images/2025/add-val-agent.png><img src=/images/2025/add-val-agent.png alt="Figure 1 - Adding the Valuation Agent"></a></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><em>Figure 1 - Adding the Valuation Agent</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id=4-high-level-design>4.

In particular:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Sentiment Agent</strong> uses VADER and TextBlob libraries which should represent a simple but effective solution since presumably news will be exclusively in English and won&rsquo;t require deep contextual understanding. In the future, more sophisticated sentiment analysis models based on LLM or specific models like FinBERT could be integrated.</li><li>The <strong>Fundamental Agent</strong> employs keyword matching on Yahoo Finance data instead of true RAG techniques with vector databases</li><li>In general, I focused on architecture rather than specific performance of individual agents</li></ul><p>All code is available on <a href=https://github.com/c-daniele/alpha-agents-a2a>GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id=51-technology-stack-and-dependencies>5.1 Technology Stack and Dependencies<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#51-technology-stack-and-dependencies>#</a></h2><p>The project uses <strong>Python 3.12</strong> as runtime with <strong>uv</strong> as package manager for rapid dependency management.

Its main responsibilities include:</p><ol><li><strong>Intelligent debate detection</strong>: Uses LLM to determine if the query requires structured debate</li><li><strong>Automatic risk tolerance inference</strong>: Analyzes user message to identify risk profile</li><li><strong>Multilingual routing</strong>: Identifies necessary agents regardless of query language</li><li><strong>Debate orchestration</strong>: Manages fair participation through a round-robin turn system</li><li><strong>Consensus monitoring</strong>: Verifies agreement and terminates debate when appropriate</li><li><strong>Metadata enhancement</strong>: Automatically enriches metadata with risk_tolerance for all agents</li></ol><h3 id=531-risk-tolerance-inference>5.3.1 Risk Tolerance Inference<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#531-risk-tolerance-inference>#</a></h3><p>The system uses an <strong>LLM-based classifier</strong> that analyzes the user&rsquo;s message to infer the risk profile. The classification guidelines include:</p><ol><li><strong>Explicit risk preferences</strong>: Terms like &ldquo;conservative,&rdquo; &ldquo;aggressive,&rdquo; &ldquo;high growth,&rdquo; &ldquo;safe,&rdquo; &ldquo;stable&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Investment timeframe</strong>: Mentions of &ldquo;retirement,&rdquo; &ldquo;long term,&rdquo; &ldquo;quick gains&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Vocabulary analysis</strong>: Linguistic choices and tone (cautious vs confident vs speculative)</li><li><strong>Asset types mentioned</strong>: Bonds/dividends = averse, growth stock = seeking</li><li><strong>Multilingual support</strong>: Works in any language by analyzing intent and risk signals</li></ol><p>As I anticipated earlier, I have no idea how the BlackRock researchers identified the risk profile. However, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine they did something similar.</p><h3 id=532-code-excerpt>5.3.2 Code Excerpt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#532-code-excerpt>#</a></h3><p>Below is an excerpt from the <code>A2AGroupChatAgent</code> class illustrating some of the main methods:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>class</span> <span class=nc>A2AGroupChatAgent</span><span class=p>:</span>

This comprehensive approach involved valuation, sentiment, and fundamental analyses, ensuring a well-rounded perspective.</p><p><strong>🎯 CONSENSUS AND KEY FINDINGS:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Valuation</strong>: Palantir has demonstrated an extraordinary annualized return of 423.86% with a high Sharpe ratio of 5.77, indicating exceptional risk-adjusted returns. The volatility is high, but the risk-reward profile is favorable.</li><li><strong>Sentiment</strong>: The sentiment analysis shows a strong positive outlook, with 83% of articles reflecting positive sentiment. This aligns with the valuation analysis, reinforcing Palantir&rsquo;s growth potential.</li><li><strong>Fundamentals</strong>: Palantir&rsquo;s strong growth metrics and operational efficiency support the positive sentiment and valuation findings.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendation: STRONG BUY</strong>. Palantir is recommended for risk-seeking investors due to its exceptional growth potential and positive sentiment, making it an attractive option for maximizing returns.</p><p><strong>2. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA):</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Valuation</strong>: Tesla has a strong annualized return of 59.42% with high volatility. The Sharpe ratio of 0.76 suggests moderate risk-adjusted returns. The potential for significant returns exists, but with substantial risk.</li><li><strong>Sentiment</strong>: The sentiment analysis is neutral with a slight negative tilt, reflecting concerns about automotive sector challenges and regulatory issues with Tesla&rsquo;s Full Self-Driving technology.</li><li><strong>Fundamentals</strong>: Operational challenges and strategic uncertainties contribute to a more cautious outlook.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendation: HOLD</strong>. While Tesla has potential upside, the current sentiment and operational challenges suggest a more cautious approach. Investors should wait for more positive sentiment or strategic clarity before increasing exposure.</p><p><strong>🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATION:</strong></p><p>Based on the collective reasoning from the multi-agent debate, <strong>Palantir (PLTR)</strong> is the preferred choice for a risk-seeking investor aiming for maximum returns over a 5-7 year horizon. Its strong positive sentiment, exceptional risk-adjusted returns, and growth potential make it a compelling investment.</p><p><strong>Tesla (TSLA)</strong>, while still a strong contender, is recommended as a hold due to its current neutral sentiment and operational challenges.

Conclusions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#7-conclusions>#</a></h1><h2 id=71-project-motivations-and-objectives>7.1 Project Motivations and Objectives<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#71-project-motivations-and-objectives>#</a></h2><p>This project was born from the need to <strong>concretely test the A2A protocol and Agent Registry</strong> in a real application scenario, to experiment with a distributed multi-agent application.</p><p>As I highlighted in the introduction, the proliferation of monolithic GenAI frameworks and their limitations in multi-agent support pushed me to invest some time to <strong>raise the level of abstraction</strong> and try to design an A2A-based agent architecture, in order to guarantee:</p><ul><li><strong>Communication standardization</strong> between heterogeneous agents</li><li><strong>Elimination of lock-in</strong> to specific frameworks</li><li><strong>Horizontal scalability</strong> through distributed deployments</li><li><strong>Interoperability</strong> between agents implemented with different technology stacks</li></ul><p>This small project kept me up a few nights but gave me the chance to get hands-on with <strong>a REAL multi-agent system</strong> different from the monolithic case study that is often presented in the &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; section of this or that GenAI framework.</p><p>I&rsquo;m increasingly convinced that for Enterprise solutions, it&rsquo;s worth starting to think seriously about agent architecture and collaboration protocols rather than the specific technology stack for implementing this or that Use Case.</p><h2 id=72-the-choice-of-alphaagents>7.2 The Choice of AlphaAgents<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#72-the-choice-of-alphaagents>#</a></h2><p>The selection of the <strong>BlackRock AlphaAgents</strong> paper as a use case proved particularly successful because, despite not overly high complexity, it allowed me to create an end-to-end solution with tangible and measurable results.</p><p>Compared to the original paper, I had to accept some compromises to simplify implementation, but this did not compromise achieving my objective.</p><h2 id=73-future-developments>7.3 Future Developments<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#73-future-developments>#</a></h2><p>The end-to-end test confirmed the validity of the approach and also provided me with some insights for future improvements.</p><h3 id=741-technical-improvements>7.4.1 Technical Improvements<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#741-technical-improvements>#</a></h3><p><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Round 1 Parallelization</strong>: Potential reduction from 91s to ~35s</li><li><strong>Data caching</strong>: Avoid multiple retrievals of same tickers</li><li><strong>LLM optimization</strong>: Prompt engineering to reduce latency</li></ul><p><strong>Agent reliability</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Sentiment Agent</strong>: FinBERT integration for more accurate analysis</li><li><strong>Fundamental Agent</strong>: True RAG implementation with vector embeddings</li><li><strong>Risk Assessment</strong>: More sophisticated models for portfolio risk management</li></ul><p><strong>Registry improvements</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Agent versioning</strong> and compatibility management</li><li><strong>Load balancing</strong> for agents with multiple instances</li><li><strong>Health monitoring</strong> and automatic failover</li></ul><h3 id=742-functional-expansions>7.4.2 Functional Expansions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#742-functional-expansions>#</a></h3><p><strong>New Specialized
