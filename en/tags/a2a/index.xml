      <description>Introduction During these scorching August days, I took the opportunity to thoroughly read Google&amp;rsquo;s A2A protocol specification and try to understand how to use its concepts to design an enterprise Agent architecture, possibly free from technological or platform constraints.
What is A2A? The Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol is an open standard designed and publicly shared by Google to facilitate communication and collaboration among AI agents. The standardization of AI interoperability model is a topic that has been discussed since the very first moments when we started talking about Agents, and there are several reasons for this:</description>
